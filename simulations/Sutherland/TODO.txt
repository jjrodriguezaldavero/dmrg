TODO for the Sutherland model:

- Extract central charges for larger values of L to make sure that it is 2.
- Study the energy gaps for excited states above the degeneracy.
- Clean up the rough topography circle to show the reflection symmetry along theta=pi/4.
- Extract scaling dimensions along the sector.
