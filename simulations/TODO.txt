In general:
    - Restyle the plots for the thesis.
    - Figure out the relation between fusion (OPE) coefficients and the central charge.

ANNNI:

ANNNP:
    FiniteSizeScaling:
        OK SIMULATIONS: C1
        - Compute finite size scaling close to G2 with a finite value of V. 
            - Figure out where is the critical point. *
        - Compute finite size scaling at C2. *
    FrustrationFree:
        OK SIMULATIONS: 
        - Plot the data I already have for the log scale planes at G1.
        - Plot higher excited states to simul the Figure 3 in Jurriaan's paper.
        - Compute frustration free planes in log scale in G2 and G3. Always with PBCs. *
    RoughTopography:
        OK SIMULATIONS: 
        - Compute the FU plane for V = -0.2, 0, 0.2 to get the critical points for the plane
        - Repeat the UV plane simulation with the canonical flags to filter unconverged points.
    ScalingDimensions:
        - Compute the scaling dimensions and central charge for C1, C2 and close to G2. * DONE FOR C1 AND G2
        - Repeat the simulations for C1 and G2 trying to reuse the present results for a higher resolution.


Sutherland:
    PhaseDiagram:
        - Compute central charges for very large system sizes with the fitting function (200-300)
        - Clean up plots for the data I already have.
    RoughTopography:
        - Repeat the simulations for mid sizes filtering out unconverged points to show symmetry.
    ScalingDimensions:
        - Compute scaling dimensions with smaller energy tolerance (1e-7)

TFI:
    ExactDiagonalization:
        - Compare ED, DMRG and the analytical energies.
