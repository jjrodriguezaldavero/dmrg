TODO for the ANNNP model:

- Make more experiments along the G2 point to make sure that there is a Potts transition:
    - Compute scaling dimensions with MERA and compare with benchmark.
    - Compute critical exponents with DMRG at other points.

- Fit the frustration-free effects as an exponential in L.
- Compute the rough topography FU planes for different values of V and extract the critical points.
    - Compute the equation for the critical plane from these points.

- Compute scaling dimensions with MERA at C1.
